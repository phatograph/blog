      <p>Well, I intended to write this post just about editors I have been using
or had used before. But it went more like my whole skill, so I changed
the topic /facepalm.</p>

<p>Speaking about editors, a wand of developers. I have use several of them since I began
my job as a coder. Some are complex IDE, some are simple text editors. Let’s
take some years back.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>

<pre><code>Skills: HTML, CSS + SASS, ASP.net, PHP, JS + CS, Node, RoR.
Editors: Netbeans, VS2008-12, Sublime, Vim.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="the-dark">The Dark</h3>

<p>I didn’t code anything when I was in highschool. I didn’t understand coding
at all. There was a computer class by then assigned me some Pascal homework
(I think It was Pascal .. can’t really remember) and some very basic HTML without
any CSS.</p>

<p>Before I chose my major as Computer Science I was confusing between an archtect,
an engineer, even a dentist. That time I was playing a MMORPG game and I was
introduced a botting system (that was evil .. I’m sorry).
I started configure some script and loved it.
So I chose this CS major. Until this day, I know by myself I didn’t make a
wrong choice ;)</p>

<h3 id="ice-age">Ice Age</h3>

<p>Ahh once a CS freshies. In the first year there was a programming class
coding some <strong>C</strong> basics using <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/">LCC-win32</a>
and I think that was my first IDE. I didn’t understand anything,
syntax ? compiling ? <code>int void main()</code> ? Everything seemed to be too scary.</p>

<p>The next language was <strong>Java</strong> using <a href="https://netbeans.org/">Netbeans</a>
5 or 6 I guess, first met with OOP. Even I could perform in the exam quite well,
I still didn’t really understand what programming is.</p>

<h3 id="coldsnap">Coldsnap</h3>

<p>Later years in CS there was a Computer System class and I had a chance
to write some <strong>Assembly</strong> scripts, but I totally forget the tools I used.
Same as tools for OS, AI, Logic and Functional Programming classes,
I remember once I wrote <strong>Haskell</strong> and <strong>Lisp</strong>, but don’t know how.
Netbeans was still there used to write Java applets in Computer Graphics class.</p>

<p>I did my senior project in Computer Vision field using <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">Matlab</a>.
That was really weird for me right now, as a Web Developer.
Since then I havn’t had a chance to work in this field anymore, and I’m happy with that.</p>

<h3 id="tempest">Tempest</h3>

<p>I was graduated! But sadly I couldn’t write any solid usable program.
So I applied for a doctoral scholarship. (Un?)fortunately I was rejected
and become lost. At that time my friend @chakrit and some others were working
at the startup company. Thus he invited me to join.</p>

<p>I was taught to write some basic frontend before, so I became a frontend guy
at the company.</p>

<p>My life with web development has begun by then.</p>

<p>.. And also my relationship with M$ Visual Studio, 2008 by that time.</p>

<h3 id="stronghold">Stronghold</h3>

<p>At the time being, grid-based <strong>CSS</strong> frameworks were becoming polular.
I studied <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint</a> and tried to understand
the idea. And based on that, I created my very first framework,
the <a href="https://github.com/phatograph/draftsman">Draftsman</a>’s grid.
I have learnt most of my skills from <a href="net.tutsplus.com">Nettuts</a>,
<a href="http://davidwalsh.name/">David Walsh</a>, <a href="http://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyier</a>
and other blogs as well.</p>

<p>Apart from <strong>ASP.net MVC (C#)</strong> (beta or 1) projects, which were company’s cores,
I also responsibled in some <strong>PHP</strong> projects. I used <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter">CodeIgniter</a>
in Netbeans for PHP and it worked great, though quite slow but acceptable.</p>

<h3 id="saga">Saga</h3>

<p>After a year I left my first company and joined a bigger one, much bigger.
I was still a frontend guy but this time the UI team I was in use
<strong>ASP.net WebForm</strong>.</p>

<p>Couple of months passed and the company upgraded VS
from 2008 to 2010. Seriously, I had hard times with the IDE since
the solution was very huge and complex, and my machine got only 2Gb RAM.
VS2010 usually hangs up and crashed when I started multitasking.
Things got slightly better when boosted up to 4Gb (whlist WinXP could
only use 3.xGb) but sometimes with 3+ times hang-in-a-row I just
want to throw something.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I became interested in <strong>JavaScript</strong> much more. I had been written
some <strong>jQuery</strong> since first company. But in the project it used <strong>Prototype.js</strong>,
some RC or beta version. I upgraded it to 1.7.x and learnt some lessons
along the way. I found out that, for me, many JS fundamental were hard
to understand and remember, so I started <a href="http://blog.phatograph.com/index.php/tag/javascript/">blogging</a>
about them.</p>

<p>Blogging has become really helpful for me since then.</p>

<h3 id="destiny">Destiny</h3>

<p>I decided to bought myself my first <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/sp619">Macbook</a>.
The reason was because I had been reading articles about JavaScript
and discovered <strong>Node.js</strong>. I really wanted to try them out. At when I was diciding to buy
it turned out my sister needed a laptop for her homework, so I gave her
my <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/laptops/ideapad/y-series/y450">old one</a> and
bought the beloved Macbook. And began to fall in love with Unix.</p>

<p>After Node.js I wanted to try our more things. What is NoSQL ? Just try it,
MongoDB, CouchDB. <strong>CoffeeScript</strong> ? Sounds nice, try it. I wrote some simple <strong>Django</strong>
and <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> projects. At that time I heard about a company
hiring a Rails guy, I was interested, and got myself deeper in Rails.</p>

<p>Gah I totally forget about Editors.
One stupid reason for me to but a Mac is I wanted to use TextMate.
I tried it trial, nice, and swtich to Coda, hmm quite well too. But
I don’t want to pay for a license. Then there was Sublime 2, which
I thought its package management is really awesome. So it became my
main editor in OSX.</p>

<h3 id="invasion">Invasion</h3>

<p>Three years with ASP.net C#, I decided to leave it.
I joined the Rails company and became much more serious about Rails,
and the web technologies.</p>

<p>So much things to learn everyday, <a href="heroku.com">Heroku</a> is my hosting choice
also with self-managed VPS on <a href="digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>.
CI service by <a href="travis-ci.org/">TravisCI</a>, special thanks for deploying this
blog!</p>

<p>I have become more familiar and prefer <strong>Git</strong> and Version Control system
(I also prefer GUI based with <a href="http://sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a>.
<strong>SVN</strong> is also fine, if I have to.
I use BitBucket for private projects, GitHub for open sources, and
<a href="https://unfuddle.com/">Unfuddle</a> for SVN.</p>

<p>Since I have a good feeling with console using <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>,
one crazy day I forced myself to drop Sublime and began using Vim. I want
to use it for a long time but I couldn’t, always fell asleep when reading tutorials.
This time I tried to use it in a daily processes. With a help from
my genius friend @chakrit I slowly get used to it more and more.
Now I even have my own <a href="https://github.com/phatograph/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>.
I’m very happy that I’m happy with Vim.</p>

<h3 id="planeshift">Planeshift</h3>

<p>For now Rails is my first weapon of choice, follow by Node.js, PHP,
and still ASP.net MVC I guess. Many should come by and I’m still
happy with this wab development thingy eveyday. It’s good to
recall old memories and take a look back what I have done in this career path.
And I have a thought with myself that I’ll keep going, higher and higher
everyday.</p>

<p>The sky is a limit, developers.</p>
