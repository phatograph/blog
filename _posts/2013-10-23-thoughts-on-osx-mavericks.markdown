Mavericks had been officially released. I installed in the next morning and
started play around with it.

At first glances I haven't figured out any UI changes.
I then immediately checked my development stacks if they still work.
`rbenv` and `nvm` both seem to work well,
I was able to run Rails and Node.js app like I could before.
Just some reinstallation of `nokogiri` gem.
Everything works just fine! Very glad with that.

Now there came random discoveries:

- Launchpad and Show Desktop animation seems to be more slick. Don't like this much.

- Safari 7 scrolling has changed slightly, become somehow more ‘stirct’
to movements. Not sure I like this but should get used to it in no time.

- ‘Open Link in New Tab’ has been moved to topmost in context menu. Great!

- Thai font has become more crisp.

- Auto '' substitute with ‘’ and "" with “”

- My favourite one, quick preview image (by tapping space) is zoomable now.

Just several reasons here could make me love this newly release.
I have a thought that Apple still pays attention in these
small user experience things, and that's great.
Even not many people might care, I do, and I'm really thankful for all of these.

<3 you Apple. Just keep doing great things.
